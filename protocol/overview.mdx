## Moony Protocol

<img src="/images/pattern2.png" alt="Moony Pattern" style={{ borderRadius: '1rem', width: '100%' }} />

Moony is a decentralized monetary protocol designed as a digital public good. It provides open access to financial participation, enables trustless peer-to-peer value exchange, and establishes a composable foundation for a decentralized global economy.

At the core of the protocol is an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain that deterministically governs the distribution and circulation of a fixed-supply digital asset, without discretionary control or centralized coordination.
