<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Moony's price discovery is governed by an onchain bonding curve, a deterministic mathematical function encoded within the Moony Reserve. The pricing curve adjusts the token's spot price based solely on the current absolute supply of MNY in circulation.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
This mechanism applies symmetrically to both unlocking and redemption. When MNY is unlocked from the pre-minted supply, the pricing curve determines the required USDF contribution according to the current circulating supply. When MNY is redeemed, the same curve determines the USDF returned. All participants interact with the same pricing function, enforced uniformly by the contract's immutable logic.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
As circulating supply increases, the bonding curve raises the price in a non-linear fashion. This structure rewards early participation through lower entry costs while requiring later participants to contribute proportionally more liquidity. These price differences arise mechanically from the public state of the system at the time of interaction, not from identity, special access, or discretionary allocation.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Because the bonding curve operates transparently and permissionlessly, access to MNY is governed by open, predictable rules rather than gatekeeping or administrative control. The pricing curve ensures that growth reflects real demand, reinforces scarcity over time, and aligns economic participation with the long-term integrity of the network.

## Core Features

  <div className="principle-card" style={{
    border: '1px solid #e5e7eb',

    }}>
      As MNY is unlocked from the Moony Reserve, circulating supply increases. The bonding curve responds deterministically by adjusting the price upward with each transaction, ensuring that new supply enters circulation at progressively higher valuations as demand grows.
    </p>

      When MNY is redeemed for USDF, the same bonding curve governs the return value based on the current circulating supply. This symmetry ensures that entry and exit pricing follow identical, predictable rules at every point on the pricing curve.

      All pricing behavior is fully deterministic and enforced by immutable onchain logic. Prices cannot be altered, overridden, or manually adjusted, allowing participants to independently verify outcomes and interact with the system without trust or discretion.

      Participation occurs under identical public rules applied equally to every participant. Earlier interactions occur at lower supply levels, while later interactions contribute proportionally more liquidity as demand grows, reinforcing collective value formation over time.

## Model Parameters

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
The bonding curve implemented in the Moony Reserve uses a discrete bonding curve implementation, where pricing values are sampled from an underlying exponential function at fixed supply intervals. This approach enables efficient on-chain computation through precomputed lookup tables.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
The underlying mathematical model defines the spot price (the instantaneous price per MNY token) at any given level of circulating supply using an exponential function. Rather than computing this exponential function and its integrals on-chain for each transaction, the protocol uses precomputed lookup tables that contain discrete values sampled from this mathematical curve at fixed supply intervals. These tables enable fast, gas-efficient pricing calculations while maintaining the exact same curve shape and pricing behavior defined by the mathematical formulas below.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
When a participant unlocks or redeems MNY, the Moony Reserve determines pricing by looking up values from these precomputed tables, which are derived from integrating the spot price function over the relevant supply intervals. This discrete implementation ensures that pricing reflects the exact position and size of each transaction along the pricing curve while minimizing on-chain computation costs.
