<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Moony uses a distribution model called Proof of Capital (PoC), implemented entirely through its immutable onchain Moony Reserve. Under this model, MNY enters circulation exclusively in exchange for verifiable onchain capital, ensuring that distribution is transparent, market-driven, and free from discretionary control.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
Rather than relying on private allocations, discretionary issuance, or off-chain mechanisms, participation in Moony's monetary system is tied directly to real economic commitment. Every unit of MNY unlocked into circulation corresponds to capital deposited onchain, aligning growth with genuine demand.
</p>

<p style={{ marginBottom: '1.5rem' }}>
The Moony Reserve retains all deposited capital as protocol liquidity, forming a persistent, verifiable foundation beneath the circulating supply. This liquidity enables redemptions and anchors Moony's monetary system in observable value, while all pricing and distribution behavior is enforced deterministically by the contract's immutable logic.
