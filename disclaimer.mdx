### 1. General Notice

This documentation is provided solely for informational and educational purposes. It does not constitute financial, investment, legal, tax, or other professional advice, nor should it be relied upon as such. Nothing contained herein should be interpreted as an offer, solicitation, recommendation, or endorsement to acquire, hold, use, or dispose of any digital asset, or to engage in any transaction or strategy.

Interaction with blockchain-based systems is inherently experimental and voluntary. Any use of the Moony protocol or reliance on this documentation is undertaken entirely at the user's own risk. Users are responsible for conducting their own research and, where appropriate, consulting qualified professional advisors before engaging with decentralized technologies.

### 2. Moony Protocol Overview

Moony is a decentralized monetary protocol implemented through an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain.

Once deployed onchain, the protocol operates autonomously according to its code. It is permissionless and self-executing, and does not depend on any company, organization, or individual for its ongoing operation. No representation is made that the protocol will function as intended in all circumstances, maintain any particular value, or achieve any specific outcome.

The protocol's behavior is determined solely by its onchain logic and the actions of independent network participants.

### 3. Role of Moony Labs LLC

Moony Labs LLC served a narrowly defined role in the initial deployment of the Moony protocol. That role is limited to the act of publishing the protocol onchain and making related documentation publicly available.

Moony Labs does not own, operate, or control the protocol following deployment. It does not retain administrative privileges, upgrade authority, or discretionary control over token supply, protocol behavior, or network participation. There are no privileged keys, pause mechanisms, or backdoors.

Moony Labs does not receive proceeds from the protocol, does not participate in reserve flows, and does not hold any special economic position relative to other participants. The deployment was conducted without venture financing, token pre-sales, or investor-linked performance expectations.

No ongoing development, maintenance, promotion, or stewardship is promised or implied. The protocol is not dependent on continued involvement by Moony Labs to exist or function.

This limited role is intentional. The protocol is designed to exist as neutral public infrastructure, shaped by open participation rather than centralized coordination.

### 4. Risks, No Warranties, and Limitation of Liability

Blockchain technologies involve material risks, including but not limited to market volatility, smart contract vulnerabilities, network congestion or outages, cybersecurity incidents, irreversible transactions, and the potential for total loss of digital assets.

The Moony protocol and all related documentation are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. Moony Labs LLC makes no representations or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, security, or non-infringement.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Moony Labs LLC disclaims all liability for any direct or indirect losses or damages arising from use of the protocol, reliance on this documentation, or interaction with blockchain systems, regardless of whether such losses were foreseeable.

### 5. Open Source References and Documentation

For transparency and reproducibility, this site references public repositories and technical materials associated with the original deployment. These materials are provided as open reference resources for developers, researchers, and other interested parties.

Where applicable, such materials are governed by their respective open-source licenses. Moony Labs does not claim proprietary rights over third-party software and does not restrict lawful use, modification, or redistribution of such materials in accordance with those licenses.

### 6. Regulatory Considerations

Nothing in this documentation should be interpreted as creating, implying, or guaranteeing any regulatory status, classification, or compliance outcome for the Moony protocol or any associated digital asset.

Regulatory treatment of blockchain technologies varies across jurisdictions and may change over time. Users are solely responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and regulations relevant to their activities.

### 7. Updates

This disclaimer may be updated from time to time to reflect clarifications or changes in context. Any updates will be posted on this page with a revised date. Continued access to or use of the documentation constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
