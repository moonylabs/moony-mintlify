</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Micropayments, transactions valued in cents or fractions of a cent, have historically been impractical under legacy financial rails. Percentage‑based fees, multi‑day settlement cycles, and reliance on centralized intermediaries make low‑value transfers uneconomical, cutting off entire categories of digital commerce.

</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify', marginTop: '1rem' }}>

These limitations have forced creators, developers, and small businesses into centralized platforms that aggregate payments, take substantial fees, and control audience relationships. Moony removes these barriers. Built for high‑volume, low‑value transactions, it combines extreme divisibility with near‑zero fees to make micropayments viable at a global scale. By doing so, it unlocks entirely new economic behaviors that were previously impossible or uneconomical.

</div>

## Why It Matters

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Micropayments are not simply smaller versions of ordinary transactions, they are a missing building block of the modern internet economy. The inability to move tiny amounts of value efficiently has shaped the digital landscape in ways that limit innovation and inclusion.

  <div className="principle-card" style={{
    border: '1px solid #e5e7eb',
    borderRadius: '0.75rem',
    padding: '1.5rem',
    marginBottom: '0',
    backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
    boxShadow: '0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)'
  }}>
    <div style={{
      fontSize: '1rem',

      lineHeight: '1.6',
      color: '#475569',
      fontSize: '0.9375rem'
    }}>
      The impracticality of per-use billing forces consumers into subscription models, paying for more than they actually use. This all-or-nothing approach creates barriers to entry, limits access to content and services, and results in wasted spending on unused features or content. Micropayments enable true pay-per-use models that align costs with actual consumption.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div className="principle-card" style={{
    border: '1px solid #e5e7eb',

      fontSize: '0.9375rem'
    }}>
      Entire categories of applications, such as real-time metering, per-unit API calls, or machine-to-machine commerce, remain underdeveloped because payment systems cannot handle the volume or economics they require. These use cases demand high-frequency, low-value transactions that traditional payment infrastructure cannot support economically, leaving significant innovation opportunities unrealized.

      Without cost-effective direct payment rails, creators and small businesses are forced into platforms that bundle transactions, take large fees, and control access to audiences. This centralization concentrates power in a few gatekeepers, limiting competition and innovation while extracting significant value from content creators and service providers who have few alternatives.

## The Opportunity

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Moony's architecture is purpose‑built to make micropayments economically viable at global scale. The token's extreme divisibility allows transactions measured in fractions of a cent, ideal for tipping, micro‑rewards, metered services, and other fine‑grained use cases.

</div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify', marginTop: '1rem' }}>

Every transfer settles on the Solana blockchain with trust‑minimized execution and irreversible finality, eliminating reliance on banks, processors, or escrow services. Solana's high‑throughput design keeps fees to a fraction of a cent and confirms transactions in seconds, free from banking hours or remittance corridors. Low fees are the foundation that make real‑time, granular monetization possible, enabling sustainable small‑value transfers that expand markets, drive innovation, and open the digital economy to all.

    }}>
      Enable true pay-per-use access to discrete pieces of content like articles, videos, AI queries, or software features without forcing users into recurring subscriptions. Consumers pay only for the specific content or functionality they access, creating a more flexible alternative to all-or-nothing subscription models while giving creators new ways to monetize individual pieces of work.

      Integrate seamless in-app purchases for digital items, upgrades, event access, or premium features without traditional credit card infrastructure or complex payment processor integrations. Applications built on blockchain can enable native token-based transactions that settle instantly, reducing technical complexity and transaction friction for developers implementing purchase flows.

      Transfer value continuously in real time for ongoing services like media consumption, cloud computing, or API access. Streaming payments enable dynamic billing models where payment flows automatically match usage patterns, creating more accurate and fair pricing structures for services consumed over time rather than as one-time purchases.

      Automate the exchange of resources like bandwidth, energy, data, or compute power in precise micro-increments between machines, devices, or services. Machine-to-machine commerce enables autonomous economic coordination at scales and frequencies impossible with traditional payment systems, unlocking new models for resource sharing, IoT ecosystems, and decentralized infrastructure.

      Send low-fee micro-tips or small contributions directly to artists, streamers, writers, or creators without intermediary platforms taking large cuts or controlling the relationship. Direct support enables authentic connections between creators and their audiences, allowing fans to contribute meaningful amounts that add up over time while creators retain full control over their revenue streams.

By combining scarce, divisible digital cash with low‑cost, high‑throughput settlement, Moony turns micropayments from an abstract ideal into a practical, composable building block for a decentralized, internet‑native economy.

<Info>

Solana network fees for MNY transfers typically cost less than $0.001, making even sub-cent transactions economically viable. These fees are paid in SOL (Solana's native token) and are separate from any MNY being transferred.
