Moony is designed as a foundational digital asset for a decentralized, composable economic system. It supports a wide range of real economic activity, from everyday payments to programmable financial interactions, without reliance on centralized intermediaries. Open access and permissionless participation allow Moony to function as a shared medium of exchange across applications, platforms, and communities.
