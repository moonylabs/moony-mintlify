  <Accordion title="What is the total supply?">
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>
      <p>Moony has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million units, an immutable constraint that cryptographically ensures the protocol's long-term economic integrity. There is no mechanism by which additional units can ever be created, guaranteeing that the total supply remains permanently capped.</p>
