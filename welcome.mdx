## About Moony Labs

<div style={{ textAlign: 'justify' }}>

Moony was deployed by Moony Labs, LLC. as a decentralized monetary protocol designed to operate as a digital public good. The system runs on open-source infrastructure and is governed entirely by immutable smart contract logic, with no ongoing control over issuance, pricing, or circulation by any organization. Once deployed, the protocol functions independently, evolving through open participation rather than centralized management.
