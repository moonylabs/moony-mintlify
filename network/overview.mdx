The Moony network is a decentralized, permissionless monetary system shaped through independent participation rather than centralized control. Its growth and resilience emerge from the collective actions of individuals and groups who choose to build with it, use it, integrate it, and exchange with it. No single organization or governing authority directs the network.

Moony operates as open digital infrastructure. Participation requires no identity, approval, or privileged access. Innovation is permissionless, and communities form organically around real world utility. As adoption expands through everyday use and independent contribution, the value of the underlying asset reflects that growth, aligning individual initiative with collective value creation without centralized management.

Although the protocol was deployed by Moony Labs, LLC., it operates independently and without ongoing governance. Its evolution is driven by open collaboration on a shared foundation. Developers integrate Moony into applications and infrastructure. Merchants adopt it as a medium of exchange. Creators and educators expand awareness and understanding. Each contribution strengthens the network as an open monetary system and advances Moony as a digital public good.
