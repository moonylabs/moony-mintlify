## Moony Network

The Moony network exists as a decentralized, permissionless system shaped through the independent participation of a global community. Its growth, resilience, and direction do not arise from any single organization, coordinating body, or governing authority, but from the collective actions of individuals and groups who choose to build with it, use it, teach it, integrate it, and exchange with it.
