Moony is a decentralized monetary protocol deployed on the Solana blockchain by Moony Labs LLC. The Moony protocol exists as a specific, immutable onchain instance created using standardized, open-source infrastructure developed and maintained by Code Inc., the parent company of Flipcash Inc. The underlying software, smart contract logic, and deployment tooling used to create the Moony protocol are released under the MIT License.

This page explains the licensing context applicable to the Moony protocol, including the relationship between upstream open-source software, the act of deployment, and the resulting onchain system that operates under the name Moony.

## Open Source Foundations

The Moony protocol was created using publicly available open-source software developed by Code Inc., including components of what is commonly referred to as the Open Code Protocol. This software defines the contract logic, economic rules, and technical parameters governing all deployments created through the system. The upstream repositories are licensed under the MIT License, which permits unrestricted use, modification, and redistribution of the software, subject only to the inclusion of the original copyright notice and license text.

Moony Labs did not author, modify, or customize the underlying smart contract code or its parameters. Instead, Moony Labs used Code's standardized deployment infrastructure as provided, invoking an existing open-source mechanism that enables third parties to publish autonomous smart contract instances on the Solana blockchain.

## Role of Moony Labs

Moony Labs' role was limited to the origination and publication of a specific onchain deployment using this standardized infrastructure. Through this process, Moony Labs initiated the creation of a unique smart contract instance on Solana and assigned the name "Moony" to that deployment at the time of creation. This act established a distinct and publicly verifiable protocol instance that operates independently and autonomously once deployed.

Moony Labs did not design the contract logic, determine economic parameters, or retain any discretionary control over the protocol following deployment. The Moony protocol executes exclusively according to its immutable onchain rules, which apply equally to all participants and cannot be altered by Moony Labs or any other party.

While Moony Labs does not claim ownership or authorship of the underlying open-source software or contract design, it does identify and reference this particular deployment as Moony. That identification relates solely to the origination and naming of the deployment as a specific onchain instance, not to any proprietary claim over the software itself.

## MIT License Attribution

The open-source software and smart contract infrastructure used to deploy the Moony protocol are licensed under the MIT License. As required by that license, the following notice applies to the upstream software components:

Copyright © Code Inc. and contributors

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the software and associated documentation files to deal in the software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell copies of the software, subject to the inclusion of the original copyright notice and license text.

The software is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the software.

The full MIT License text can be found in the relevant upstream GitHub repositories maintained by Code Inc.

## License Status of the Moony Protocol

The Moony smart contract, as deployed on the Solana blockchain, is publicly viewable and verifiable. Once deployed, it functions as an autonomous system governed solely by its immutable onchain logic. Technical interaction with the protocol is permissionless and does not require approval from Moony Labs or any other entity.

Because the Moony protocol was created using MIT-licensed infrastructure, no additional licensing restrictions apply to technical use, inspection, integration, or replication of the underlying contract logic. Any party may deploy similar contracts or utilize the same infrastructure under different names, consistent with the terms of the MIT License.

## Use of the Name "Moony" and Associated Identity

Although the underlying software is open source, the name "Moony" refers specifically to the onchain deployment originated and published by Moony Labs. The use of the Moony name and associated branding is governed separately from software licensing considerations.

Deployments that replicate the underlying contract logic but are not the original Moony deployment may not represent themselves as Moony or imply association with the Moony protocol. Misrepresentation of unrelated deployments as Moony may be subject to enforcement under applicable trademark and unfair competition laws, independent of any software licensing permissions.

## Third-Party Participation and Forks

The Moony protocol exists as permissionless infrastructure. Independent developers, users, and organizations are free to interact with the protocol, build applications on top of it, or deploy separate instances using the same open-source tools. The ability to replicate infrastructure or deploy similar contracts does not confer the right to use the Moony name or to suggest endorsement, affiliation, or continuity with the Moony protocol.

Forking or redeploying the underlying code is permitted under the MIT License, provided that such activity does not misrepresent the resulting system as Moony or otherwise confuse users regarding its origin or identity.

## Ongoing Contributions and Maintenance

Moony Labs does not maintain proprietary versions of the underlying open-source codebase and does not exercise ongoing operational control over the Moony protocol. Any future contributions to upstream software repositories, if made, will follow open-source contribution norms and be publicly documented.

Moony exists as decentralized, permissionless infrastructure. Its use, evolution, and cultural significance are determined by the broader network of participants rather than by any central operator or issuing entity.
